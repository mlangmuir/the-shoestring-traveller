Knowing I could get a better price somewhere else, I left the restaurant after the tour guide had sat us down and had a tagine at a restaurant five minutes away for 35 dirhams (about 3 USD).

I certainly overestimated the strength of my stomach and felt a little under the weather for a couple days. Nevertheless, as long as you take precautions, street food in Morocco is not only delicious, it is also generally the cheapest option.

Nevertheless, I was quite hungry after a full day of sightseeing at the Vatican so I decided to go there and order the most inexpensive meal on the menu.

Incredibly, I was able to fit five changes of clothes into two packing cubes. Besides my clothes, I only had some toiletries, a phone charger and a water bottle to carry with me.
